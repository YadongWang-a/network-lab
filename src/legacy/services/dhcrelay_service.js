/**
 * Processes an incoming DHCP packet on behalf of a DHCP relay agent (dhcrelay).
 *
 * Relays DHCP traffic in both directions between clients on the local segment and the
 * configured upstream DHCP server. For client-originated broadcasts (DHCPDISCOVER and
 * DHCPREQUEST), rewrites addressing fields so the packet is forwarded unicast to the server.
 * For server-originated unicast replies (DHCPOFFER and DHCPACK), rewrites addressing so the
 * packet is delivered back to the client by broadcast.
 *
 * Returns undefined when the relay service is off, the packet arrived on an unlisted interface,
 * or the relay is not the intended recipient of the server reply.
 *
 * @param {string} agentObjectId - The DOM element ID of the network object acting as the DHCP relay agent.
 * @param {Object} packet - The incoming DHCP packet (mutated in-place and returned).
 * @param {string} packet.type - DHCP message type: "discover", "request", "offer", or "ack".
 * @param {string} packet.destination_ip - Destination IP address of the packet.
 * @param {string} packet.origin_ip - Source IP address of the packet.
 * @param {string} packet.origin_mac - Source MAC address of the packet.
 * @param {string} packet.destination_mac - Destination MAC address of the packet.
 * @param {string} packet.giaddr - Relay agent IP address field.
 * @param {string} packet.chaddr - Client hardware (MAC) address.
 * @param {string} packet.ciaddr - Client IP address.
 * @param {string} networkObjectInterface - The interface name on which the packet was received.
 * @returns {Promise<Object|undefined>} The mutated packet to forward, or undefined if it should be dropped.
