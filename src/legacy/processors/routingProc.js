/**
 * Performs an IP routing table lookup for the given packet and forwards it toward
 * its destination.
 *
 * **Broadcast handling:**
 * - If the destination is the limited broadcast (`255.255.255.255`) or a MAC broadcast,
 *   the packet is only forwarded when `isNotForward` is `true` (i.e. locally originated).
 *   In that case it is sent out through `outInterface` if specified, otherwise the first
 *   available interface. Routers never forward broadcast packets.
 *
 * **Unicast routing:**
 * The routing table (rendered as an HTML `<table>`) is scanned row by row. The first
 * rule whose network matches `getNetwork(packet.destination_ip, ruleNetmask)` is applied:
 * 1. The packet's source MAC is updated to the egress interface MAC.
 * 2. The next-hop IP is resolved: `ruleNetmask` value `0.0.0.0` means directly connected
 *    (use destination IP directly); otherwise use the explicit next-hop address.
 * 3. The next-hop MAC is resolved via the ARP table or, if missing, by sending an
 *    ARP request (`arpResolve`). If resolution fails the packet is dropped silently.
 * 4. **`isNotForward = true`** (locally originated packet): the OUTPUT firewall chain is
 *    applied; on pass, the packet is sent to the egress switch via `switchProcessor`.
 * 5. **`isNotForward = false`** (forwarded packet): `firewallProc` is called (handles
 *    NAT/MASQUERADE) before sending.
 *
 * @param {string} networkObjectId - The DOM element ID of the routing device.
 * @param {Object} packet - The packet to route. Its `origin_mac` and `destination_mac`
 *   fields are mutated in place during routing.
 * @param {boolean} [isNotForward=false] - `true` when the packet was originated locally
 *   (e.g. a service reply); `false` when the packet is being forwarded in transit.
 * @param {string} [outInterface=""] - Preferred egress interface name, used only for
 *   broadcast packets when `isNotForward` is `true`.
 * @returns {Promise<void>}
