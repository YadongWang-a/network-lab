/**
 * Dispatches an incoming packet to all active services installed on the network device
 * and collects their responses.
 *
 * Each service is only invoked if both the packet's protocol matches and the service is
 * listed as active by `getAvailableServices`. Dispatching rules:
 *
 * - **DHCP packets** — checked against `dhclient`, `dhcpd`, and `dhcrelay` in order.
 *   For relay responses, the output interface is derived from the `giaddr` field of the
 *   reply (OFFER/ACK are sent back toward the relay's client-facing interface).
 * - **DNS request packets** — dispatched to `named_service` when `named` is active.
 * - **HTTP request packets** — dispatched to `apache_service` when `apache2` is active.
 *
 * @param {string} networkObjectId - The DOM element ID of the network device.
 * @param {Object} packet - The incoming packet object.
 * @param {string} networkObjectInterface - The name of the interface on which the packet arrived.
 * @returns {Promise<Array<{packet: Object, outInterface: string}>>}
 *   An array of response descriptors. Each entry contains the reply packet and the
 *   output interface name to use when sending it (`""` means use normal routing).
